# Hmong Traditional Wedding Guide

## Overview

This project is a digital cultural reference documenting the traditional Hmong wedding process from beginning to end. As I continue learning the ceremonial steps, poems, and preparation rituals, I built this website to organize and preserve the knowledge in a structured and accessible format.

Understanding traditional wedding values is important to me, as these customs reflect deep-rooted principles of family, respect, and community. This project allows me to study and present the full process — from initial preparations to ceremonial speeches and required offerings.
